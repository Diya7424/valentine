          Thank you so much for loving me a lot , to make me feel so special , for taking care of me so much. I know I am a bit stupid, I always say anything without thinking , But never intended to hurt you. 

          This is our first valentine together but we are not close . But this distance won't spoil our day. I promise to be with
           you in every phase of your life , be it good or bad. I will always be there for you. 
           <br>
           I hope that our bond remains as strong on every Valentine to come.

          
          <strong>I love you a lot !! </strong>
